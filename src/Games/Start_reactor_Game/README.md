Game points:-

-Just tap on the keys as shown in the left side of the reactor to win the game.
-When the player opens the a black screen will appear on the left while nine squares appear on the right.
-The player must memorize the order of the blue squares appearing on the left screen and then replicate it using the keypad on the right.
-The player will have to memorize the five patterns.
-The first pattern to replicate will be a single square, and the second will be two squares, and so on until the maximum of five squares.
-Each pattern builds on the previous pattern. For example, the second pattern will always start with the blue square from the first pattern.


The player must wait until the screen on the left finishes displaying the squares before entering the keypad pattern.

If the player enters a pattern incorrectly, the blue squares will flash red and the process restarts, in the same order as before, and the player has another opportunity to memorize the pattern. The player may keep trying until they get it correct.

Green circles above the screen on the left indicate how many patterns have been successfully replicated. The green circles above the keypad on the right indicate the number of squares the player has currently selected for the pattern so far.
